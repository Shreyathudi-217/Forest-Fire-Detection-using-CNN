# Forest-Fire-Detection-using-CNN
A deep learning-based image classification project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to automatically detect forest fires from images. The aim is to support early detection and alert systems for wildfire prevention.

## 📖 Overview
Forest fires can have devastating impacts on the environment and biodiversity. This project uses a CNN-based image classification model to detect the presence of fire in forest imagery. It can be integrated into real-time drone or CCTV surveillance systems to automate fire detection.

## ✅ Features
- Binary classification: Fire vs. No Fire
- Custom CNN built using TensorFlow/Keras
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Easily extendable for real-time use cases

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source**: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phylake1337/fire-dataset">Dataset
- **Classes**:
  - 'Fire' – images containing forest fires
  - 'No_Fire' – normal forest landscapes

> Note: The dataset is balanced and contains images in JPEG format.
